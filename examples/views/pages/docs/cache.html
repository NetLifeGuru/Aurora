<h3>Managing Cache Creation</h3>
<p>
    In production environments, it's crucial to manage how caching is handled to ensure optimal server performance.
    By default, the template engine is set to generate a new cache whenever templates are rendered.
    However, this behavior can be adjusted based on your requirements.
</p>
<h4>Disabling Cache Creation</h4>
<p>
    To prevent the template engine from generating a new cache with each render, which can be resource-intensive in production environments, you can either remove or modify the `createCache` method call.
</p>
<span class="clearfix"></span>
<ol>
    <li><span class="bold">Removing Cache Creation Call:</span> Simply remove the line from your code where createCache(true) is called. This will stop the automatic cache generation process.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Setting Cache Creation to False:</span> Alternatively, you can explicitly set cache creation to false:</li>
</ol>
<span class="clearfix"></span>
<pre class="language-php">
    $templateEngine->createCache(false);
</pre>
<span class="clearfix"></span>
<p>This approach explicitly informs the engine not to create new cache files, which can be beneficial in a stable production environment where template changes are infrequent.</p>
