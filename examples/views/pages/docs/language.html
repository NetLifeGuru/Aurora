<h3>Setting Language Constants</h3>
<p>The template engine also supports the definition of language constants, which are crucial for internationalization and localization. These constants are similar to variables but are specifically used for language-related strings.</p>

<h4>Defining Language Constants</h4>
<p>Language constants are defined using the <span class="bold">setLanguageConstants</span> method, where each constant is assigned a corresponding value in an associative array:</p>

<pre class="language-php">
    $templateEngine->setLanguageConstants([
        'hello world' => 'Hello World',
        // ... other language constants
    ]);
</pre>
<p>This method allows for defining multiple language constants that can be easily managed and updated.</p>

<h4>Using Language Constants in Templates</h4>
<p>In the templates, language constants are referenced using a specific syntax with backticks ``. This syntax differentiates language constants from regular variables.</p>

<span class="info">Example of referencing a language constant in a template:</span>
<pre class="language-html">
    {layout}
        {`hello world`}
    {/layout}
</pre>

<h4>Output on Screen</h4>
<p>When the above template is rendered, it will output the value associated with the 'hello world' constant. In this case, the output on the screen would be:</p>

<pre class="language-text">
    Hello World
</pre>
