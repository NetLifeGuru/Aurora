<h3>Leveraging `import{{}}` for Standalone Applications with a Routing System</h3>
<p>
    In a standalone application that doesn't rely on an external framework, using the import feature can be extremely beneficial, especially for managing page-specific meta tags and other components.
    This approach enhances the flexibility and modularity of each page within your application.
</p>

<h4>Example of Structuring Routes with `import`:</h4>
<p>Consider a routing structure like the following in your standalone PHP application:</p>
<pre class="language-php">
    $templateEngine->setRoutes([
        '*' => [
            '/layout.html',
            '/components/header.html',
            '/components/footer.html',
            '/components/forms.html',
        ],
        '' => [
            '/pages/index.html',
        ],
        'docs' => [
            '/pages/docs.html',
        ],
        'contact' => [
            '/pages/contact.html',
        ],
    ]);
</pre>
<h4>Dynamic Meta Tag Management:</h4>

<p>In each specific page, like <span class="bold">docs.html</span>, you can define meta tags or other necessary head elements within a block, say <span class="bold">{{meta}}</span>:</p>
<pre class="language-php">
    {meta}
      {$title = "Dynamic Title for Docs Page"}
      {$description = "Description specific to Docs Page"}
    {/meta}
</pre>

<p>By utilizing import in your <span class="bold">layout.html</span>, you can dynamically include these meta tags into the head of your HTML structure:</p>
<pre class="language-html">
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="{$lang}">
    <head>
        {import{meta}}
        <title>{$title}</title>
        <meta name="description" content="{$description}">
        <!-- Other head elements -->
    </head>
    <body>
        include{header}
        <!-- Page Content -->
        include{footer}
    </body>
    </html>
</pre>

<h4>Advantages:</h4>

<ul>
    <li><span class="bold">Dynamic Content:</span> The use of import allows for dynamic inclusion of content like meta tags, which can be different for each page (like Home, Docs, Contact).</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Modular Structure:</span> This approach facilitates a more modular and maintainable structure for your application, with each component or block being self-contained.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Simplified Management:</span> Managing meta tags and other head elements becomes straightforward, as they are encapsulated within their respective page templates.</li>
</ul>
