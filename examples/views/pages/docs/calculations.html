<h3>Calculations</h3>
<p>Aurora supports block-based calculations, where the scope of variable modifications is confined to the block in which they occur, unless specifically imported into another block. Let’s break down the scenarios you’ve mentioned.</p>

<h4>Isolated Calculations within Blocks</h4>
<p>In this example, calculations within the <span class="bold">{{calculate}}</span> block do not affect the <span class="bold">{{layout}}</span> block. Each block operates independently, maintaining its own scope for variables:</p>
<pre class="language-php">
    {calculate}
      {$a += 1}
      {$a} // Output is 2
    {/calculate}

    {layout}
      {$a = 1}
      include{calculate}
      {$a} // Output is 1, unchanged by the {calculate} block
    {/layout}
</pre>

<p>In this case, despite incrementing <span class="bold">$a</span> in <span class="bold">{{calculate}}</span>, its value in <span class="bold">{{layout}}</span> remains unaffected due to the isolated scope of each block.</p>

<span class="clearfix"></span>
<h4>Sharing Calculated Values Across Blocks</h4>
<p>To influence the value of <span class="bold">$a</span> in <span class="bold">{{layout}}</span> based on the calculations in <span class="bold">{{calculate}}</span>, you use import instead of include. This approach effectively extends the scope of <span class="bold">{{calculate}}</span> to <span class="bold">{{layout}}</span>, allowing changes in <span class="bold">{{calculate}}</span> to reflect in <span class="bold">{{layout}}</span>:</p>

<pre class="language-php">
    {calculate}
      {$a += 1}
      {$a} // Output is 2
    {/calculate}

    {layout}
      {$a = 1}
      import{calculate}
      {$a} // Output is now 2, affected by the {calculate} block
    {/layout}
</pre>
<p>In this example, <span class="bold">import{{calculate}}</span> means that the changes made to <span class="bold">$a</span> in the <span class="bold">{{calculate}}</span> block are carried over to the <span class="bold">{{layout}}</span> block, overriding its original value.</p>

<p>
    This flexible system allows you to control the scope and impact of calculations and variable manipulations across different blocks within your template engine.
    This approach is particularly useful for managing dependencies and interactions between various sections of your templates, ensuring that changes are made only where intended.
