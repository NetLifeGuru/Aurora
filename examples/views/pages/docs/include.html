<h3>Include vs. Import in the Template Engine</h3>
<p>In our template engine, you have two distinct ways to integrate content from one block into another: <span class="bold">include</span> and <span class="bold">import</span>. Understanding the difference between these two is crucial for effectively managing the scope of variables and calculations.</p>

<h4>Using `include`</h4>
<p>The include statement is used to incorporate the content of one block into another without affecting the scope of variables.</p>
<p>When a block is included, any calculations or variable modifications in that block do not impact the variables in the block where it’s included.</p>
<p>This ensures that each block maintains its own set of variables, preventing unintended side effects.</p>
<span class="info">Example include</span>
<pre class="language-php">
    {calculate}
      {$a += 1}
      {$a} // Output is 2
    {/calculate}

    {layout}
      {$a = 1}
      include{calculate}
      {$a} // Output remains 1, as {calculate} is included without affecting scope
    {/layout}
</pre>

<h4>Using `import`</h4>
<p>The import statement, in contrast, extends the scope of the imported block to the block where it’s used.</p>
<p>This means that any variable changes or calculations in the imported block directly affect the variables in the importing block.</p>
<p>Use import when you want the actions within one block to have a direct impact on another.</p>
<span class="info">Example import</span>
<pre class="language-php">
    {calculate}
      {$a += 1}
      {$a} // Output is 2
    {/calculate}

    {layout}
      {$a = 1}
      import{calculate}
      {$a} // Output changes to 2, as {calculate} affects {layout} through import
    {/layout}
</pre>

<p class="georgia">
    In summary, while include preserves the isolation of variable scopes between blocks, import merges these scopes, allowing for the propagation of variable states and calculations.
    This feature provides a high degree of flexibility and control over the behavior of your templates, enabling complex interactions while maintaining clarity and manageability.
